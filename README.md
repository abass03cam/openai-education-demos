# 🎓 OpenAI Education Demos

This repository showcases practical applications of OpenAI's GPT models (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) for educational and creative use cases. Developed as part of the M.Sc. Computer Science program (Trustworthy Systems), it demonstrates how large language models can assist with:

- 👶 Child-friendly content simplification
- 🤖 Text-to-Emoji translation
- 📐 Automated lesson plan generation (Algebra)
- 🧠 Agent-based poem and code analysis (GPT-4o)

## 💡 Purpose

This academic project was created to explore how generative AI can enhance education, communication, and content accessibility using Python and OpenAI’s API.

## 🔧 Technologies

- Python 3.10+
- OpenAI API (gpt-3.5-turbo / gpt-4 / gpt-4o)
- Environment management with `dotenv`
- Optional: async Agent architecture

## 📁 Files

- `main.py`: Core examples (summary, emoji, lesson plan)
- `agents_demo.py`: Optional advanced GPT-4o agent demos
